b\"I entered the theatre intending to pass a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if not enlightened. I left neither entertained nor enlightened. This movie can't make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything. There are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows--for this character? come off it!). While none of the characters gets treated with much respect, the over thirty gay men get the worst of it: all predatory, fat, sad, slobs. If you're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. You'll thank me.<br /><br />\"\nLabel : 0 (neg)\nReview: b\"Though I liked On the Town better I really liked it. I'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Though I had heard of them I had never seen anything with them in it until recently. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene's. I think that is better too. But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I have yet to see them together in Take me out to the Ballgame. But I'm sticking to my guns bu saying that I really enjoyed it, and that I love it!\"\nLabel : 1 (pos)\nReview: b'Well, I just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than \"Little Britain\" and I like it! \"The League of Gentlemen\" is a sick British comedy that is about the most awful, insane and disgusting small town in all the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from \"The Vicar of Dibley\" and \"Father Ted\") seem pretty normal!! The format of the show is a lot like LITTLE Britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this one hellish town. Both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired \"Little Britain\" (particularly the job seeking class skit). But the show differs because although it is crude like \"Little Britain\" (hence not a show for kids), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show.<br /><br />Now if you haven\\'t guessed, this is NOT a show for kids, the easily offended or normal people and that\\'s probably why I liked it. However, you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max. Funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief--you have to see it to believe it.'\nLabel : 1 (pos)\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Vocabolary","metadata":{"id":"zFLbyiWf317u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PRE-trained Model","metadata":{"id":"7gWm_TX24B67"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"url = 'https://github.com/giuliocn/bert_binary_classification_imdb_reviews/releases/download/binary-classification/imdb_l10_h256_a4_bert-20231126T160856Z-001.zip'\nif not path.exists(\"imdb_l10_h256_a4_bert\"):\n  model = tf.keras.utils.get_file(\n      'imdb_l10_h256_a4_bert-20231126T160856Z-001.zip',\n      url,\n      extract=True, cache_dir='.',\n      cache_subdir='')","metadata":{"id":"klzQp0h2fdXG","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"d8086d22-5f31-4810-fc02-bab6cba322e0","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-25T17:37:27.735018Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-25T17:37:27.735362Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-25T17:37:27.740915Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-25T17:37:27.735335Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-25T17:37:27.739831Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load model from directory\nclassifier_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('imdb_l10_h256_a4_bert')\n\n# Check model architecture\nclassifier_model.summary()","metadata":{"id":"gUEWVskZjEF0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"b9a85691-ea0d-409e-d6b6-8c1b9af23bf4","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-25T17:37:30.597836Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-25T17:37:30.598488Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-25T17:37:46.133318Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-25T17:37:30.598450Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-25T17:37:46.132408Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Model: \"model\"\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n Layer (type)                Output Shape                 Param #
